# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using Python. The user plays against the computer, selecting either Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2). The computer makes a random choice, and the winner is determined based on the classic game rules. The game also features ASCII art for better visualization.
How It Works:
The user is prompted to enter a choice:
0 for Rock
1 for Paper
2 for Scissors
The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
The choices of both the user and the computer are displayed using ASCII art.
The winner is determined based on the following rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both players make the same choice, itâ€™s a draw.
If the user inputs an invalid number, the game notifies them and ends.
Features:
- User-friendly interface with ASCII art representation.
- Randomized computer moves for a fair game.
- Clear win/loss/draw logic for accurate results.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
